# Tasks

Current execution queue only. Detailed cards and historical evidence live in `docs/tracking/backlog/`.

## Rules

- Execute leaf tasks from this queue unless the user changes priority.
- `ready` requires every task dependency done and validation known.
- Keep completed history out of this file; completion remains in the owning backlog/artifact.
- React screen implementation must use the selected Focus Rail assets and design system under `DEC-028`; unapproved cross-option drift is not allowed.
- Do not use tmux/fake-Codex evidence to complete the selected app-server runtime.
- Do not use direct-LAN/custom-CA evidence to complete the selected remote path, and do not implement Tailscale behavior before `IFC-V1-070` freezes it.
- Update status only for handoff truth and run `pnpm check:planning` before completion/commit.

## Current Next Queue

| Order | Task | Status | Blocked by | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `FE-V1-090` Aggregate physical mobile-dashboard hardening | in_progress | none | Prepare one clean candidate from the pushed approval-owner correction, review it, then execute the no-retry phone acceptance once. |

`FE-V1-102` closed `BUG-073` in pushed `e82873e` with exact pending-dialog and terminal-row owners, authority/counter checkpoints, bounded private-free diagnostics, and hostile owner/geometry/state tests. All focused, full-unit, typecheck, lint/export, planning, runtime-boundary, privacy/diff, and protected-worktree gates pass without phone or remote-environment mutation. Candidate `43b93fc` remains ineligible and will not be retried.

## Intentional Blockers

| Gate | Owner | Blocker | Unblocks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Release | `REL-V1-010` | All module hardening, clean package/service/remote-phone/profile/security evidence, human acceptance | V1 release and V2 planning. |

## Status Vocabulary

- `ready`: all task dependencies are done and scope/evidence are executable.
- `todo`: defined and ordered behind unfinished task dependencies.
- `blocked`: requires human choice, physical device/account/consent, or external state beyond task dependencies.
- `in_progress`: active work.
- `done`: current wording and evidence are complete.
- `deferred`: explicitly outside V1.
